  I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Sociology at McGill University (with a concentration in population dynamics). I received an MA in Sociology from McMaster University and an HBSc in Psychology from the University of Toronto. 

  As a researcher, I rely on a range of quantitative instruments and cross-national surveys to study social, political and cultural phenomena in comparative perspective. These phenomena include, but are not limited to, ethnic identification and cultural transmission among immigrants and the links between democracy, populism and nationalism in the modern world. My work has been funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada and has appeared in the _American Sociological Review_.
  
  Outside of academia, I enjoy spicy food, hip-hop, and the Toronto Raptors (I will never forget the championship parade in 2019).
